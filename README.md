## AKA my (n)ever-coming blog

Soon...

## First attempt in 2014

I made a first run in 2014, having so much to share... finally, it did not happen!

Based on Jekill Now / Jekill / pages.github.com

Structure based on: **[Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/)**, *the essential part of ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))*

## Restart in 2019

Now in 2019, I feel the time is right.

So I restart from semi-scratch... and the last one from 2014.

*Qui vivra verra*...

## Quick start...

`bundle exec jekyll serve`
