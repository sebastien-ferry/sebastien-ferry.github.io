> "Enter" then ~ then . will kill a hung SSH connection, instead of having to close the terminal tab. I use it all the time but most people haven't heard of it.

> **blueflow** Documented in ssh(1), section "ESCAPE CHARACTERS".

``` shell
# user@machine:~ $   
# user@machine:~ $ ~?
Supported escape sequences:
 ~.   - terminate connection (and any multiplexed sessions)
 ~B   - send a BREAK to the remote system
 ~C   - open a command line
 ~R   - request rekey
 ~V/v - decrease/increase verbosity (LogLevel)
 ~^Z  - suspend ssh
 ~#   - list forwarded connections
 ~&   - background ssh (when waiting for connections to terminate)
 ~?   - this message
 ~~   - send the escape character by typing it twice
(Note that escapes are only recognized immediately after newline.)
```
