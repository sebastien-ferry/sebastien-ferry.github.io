Here is the timeline of IT security events I'm looking for...

#WIP!

<!--more-->
A big IT security event happens quite regularly since the beginning of the century.

It is usually critical, the end of the *IT* world is coming!

And finally, poof, nothing really happens... except for the people impacted!

![Oh no, anyway!](/assets/timeline-oh-no-anyway.jpg){:style="align:center; width:30%"}

IÂ´d like to find a timeline tailored to my perception... so I'm attempting this, for future!
