# Paywalls

## [https://12ft.io/](https://12ft.io/)
Bypass any paywall,
https://12ft.io/\<URL>

<summary>
<b>What?</b>

Prepend 12ft.io/ to the URL of any paywalled page, and we'll try our best to remove the paywall and get you access to the article.
<details>
<p><b>Why</b> 
I believe Google Adwords killed the web. Google Adwords incentivized sites to peddle SEO optimized garbage. Sites who aren't are forced to optimize for email capture so they can market directly to you. Search results now show "news", ads, and SEO spam instead of surfacing information.
</p><p>
You ought to be able to search something on Google and get an answer to your question without signing up for some newsletter. This is why I created 12ft.io.
How does it work?
</p><p>
The idea is pretty simple, news sites want Google to index their content so it shows up in search results. So they don't show a paywall to the Google crawler. We benefit from this because the Google crawler will cache a copy of the site every time it crawls it.
</p><p>
All we do is show you that cached, unpaywalled version of the page.
