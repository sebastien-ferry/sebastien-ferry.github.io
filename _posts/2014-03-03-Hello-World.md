*Hello World!*

With some genesis about this blog.
<!--more-->

# Probably (2014)
Welcome...

# Added (2019-10-04)

On 3 March 2014, I played with Github pages, especially with [Jekyll Now](<https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now> "Jekyll Now"):
 * From Barry Clark: <https://github.com/barryclark>
 * Github Jekyll Now: <https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start>
 * Probably inspired by: <http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/>

I definitely wasn't clear about Jekyll, Ruby, Github pages and Jekyll Now.

*I am still not clear 5 years later* :smile:...

And I finally removed/recreated it locally + github, and I am [still playing in 2019]({% post_url 2019-09-24-welcome-to-jekyll %})...

# Why you should start a blog right now?

[Alexy Guzey: Why you should start a blog right now? ](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/)

> Summary: in this post I explain why you should start a blog (to help others and to help yourself), what to write about, and how to start it. I hope to persuade you that you should start a blog even if you feel that you have nothing to say and even if almost nobody will read it.
