### EDIT 2019-10-04

On 3 March 2014, I played with Github pages, especially with [Jekyll Now](<https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now> "Jekyll Now"):
 * From Barry Clark: <https://github.com/barryclark>
 * Github Jekyll Now: <https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now#quick-start>
 * Probably inspired by: <http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/>

I definitely wasn't clear about Jekyll, Ruby, Github pages and Jekyll Now.

*I am still not clear 5 years later* :smile:...

And finally removed/recreated it locally + github. [welcome-to-jekyll]
