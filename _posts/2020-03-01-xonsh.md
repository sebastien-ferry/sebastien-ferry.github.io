Discovering Unix last century (HP-UX), I quickly enhanced my shell to tcsh.
That included tab-completion and nice scripts! Such a marvel compared to sh or csh.

Then came my first encounter with bash in linux: not a good memory.
So I used to install tcsh on my box. Except when I could not...

Alas, always fighting to install a shell, I finally embraced the default bash.
That lasted probably 20 years.

During those 20 years, things evolved (tab, color, hints, ...)
Yet, the overall state did not change.

A new era of shell is coming. Enter fish and xonsh (and more).

90% of my use of prompt: cd, ls, bc, cat, launch...

after:

same, but all in python (no more bc)
## xonsh

From [xon.sh](https://xon.sh/)
> Xonsh is a Python-powered, cross-platform, Unix-gazing shell language and command prompt.
> The language is a superset of Python 3.5+ with additional shell primitives that you are used to from Bash and IPython.
> It works on all major systems including Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows.
> Xonsh is meant for the daily use of experts and novices alike.

### +
*   Python from the console
*   Prompt in color
*   Fantastic play with prompt (see below)

### -
*   slightly slow to start (on my old box)
