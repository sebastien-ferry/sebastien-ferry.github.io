I am a happy user of xonsh shell, and let sh, csh, tcsh and bash behind...

Xonsh merges python and shell, with a terrific prompt!

<!--more-->
Discovering unix last century (hp-ux), i quickly enhanced my shell to tcsh.
that included tab-completion and nice scripts! such a marvel compared to sh or csh.

Then came my first encounter with bash in linux: not a good memory.
so i used to install tcsh on my box. except when i could not...

Alas, always fighting to install a shell, i finally embraced the default bash.
that lasted probably 20 years.

During those 20 years, things evolved (tab, color, hints, ...)
yet, the overall state did not change.

A new era of shell is coming. enter fish and xonsh (and more).

  * before: 90% of my use of prompt: cd, ls, bc, cat, launch...
  * after: same, but all in python (no more bc)
  
# xonsh

from [xon.sh](https://xon.sh/)
> xonsh is a python-powered, cross-platform, unix-gazing shell language and command prompt.
> the language is a superset of python 3.5+ with additional shell primitives that you are used to from bash and ipython.
> it works on all major systems including linux, mac osx, and windows.
> xonsh is meant for the daily use of experts and novices alike.
