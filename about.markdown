This github repository is a private / opened repository from yet-another-coder(-wannhasbeen).

There is not much at the moment for the errand.

## Why those pages!?

  * First and foremost, to keep my little ones accessible to **me**
  * Play with github
  * Invite me to more rigor in small projects (at least with a README)

Enjoy!

## License

Still hesitating between a [WTFPL](<http://www.wtfpl.net/> "DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE") and a [DBAD](<https://dbad-license.org/> "DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE") ...
